# CouchPotato
CouchPotato is a glorified watchdog client used to monitor and protect all registered titles including, but not limited too; video game digital distribution services, ("Dashboards") from crashing. CouchPotato replaces the entire desktop environment with it's own unuiqe environment. 

Similar to the likes of a console, CouchPotato will transform any and all Windows based PCs (targeted towards HTPC's in mind) the ability to start gaming from the moment you power on your system, till your ass reaches the couch.  

CouchPotato is not your replacement from your gaming source of any kind.  This is a controlled environment where it is possible to launch emulators as a way to enjoy retro gaming in your living room instead of the Steam Overlay!

Let me explain! :)


**Explanation** 

CouchPotato functions as the new desktop environment within the main Windows OS. 
CouchPotato provides all the features you will only ever use for gaming, while you game. 
_There are little goodies I have included for enthusiasts using things like, MSI afterburner tools, etc._ :)

_(The UWP apps and XBOX Overlay features designed in Windows 10+, will not work with Potato at this time.  I will need help investigating this relm further)_.

**Dashboards**, 
are often used to reference any video game digital distribution service (such as Steam, UPlay Origin, or Epic Games Store, etc.) or emulators (such as PPSSPP, Dolphin, cbxc, etc.) that CouchPotato will run after the F7 timer completes.


Upon the first initial boot into CouchPotato, you will have a 3 second timer before launching into the Dashboard. During those 3 seconds if you hit F7, you will abort the timer and the CouchPotato menu will appear. 
_You will notice the message near the top center during boot._

You can make necessary adjustments, reboot to desktop mode or to install a dashboard. Otherwise you will load into your defined Dashboard when the timer completes.


If ther is no dashboard installed after boot, you will be redirected to the CouchPotato menu to install a dashboard.



CouchPotato is strictly intended for simplicity and lightweight functionality, as it IS a replacement to the Windows Desktop Environment shell, modifying the registry. You too can still revert back into your desktop environment after a reboot takes place, each time this field changes. 


**Features**

There are settings available to you that you can adjust in CouchPotato.

At anytime your dashboard is not running you will be presented to CouchPotato's F7 timer. Only at that time you may hit F7 on your keyboard to enter CouchPotato BiOS11. 

• You can check storage capacity.

• Configure your local windows username as a future online username profile experience.  

• Adjust your graphics card settings. - _(Current GPU support is Nvidia at this time. Looking for further support to be expanded here!)_

• System Control Panel.

• etc.


_Features include:_ 
From initial launch or a crashed Dashboard, Potato will launch the dashboard after 3 seconds. Within the 3 second time frame, you have the ability to press F7 to abort the dhasborad from loading.  Afterwards, you will then be taken to the Main Menu of Couch Potato. 

Within the Main Menu of Couch Potato, you can reboot into the Windows Desktop Envrionment by any means necessary. 

Couch Potato currently works offline until a new release supports Checking Updates in the settings menu. From there you will need to use the desktop environment to update your Couch Potato files manually or overwite the entire folder as one would suggest.


**The Road Map**

• Add update checker for newer releases.

• Add controller support.

• Integrate a basic online friends list, chat system with voice, take screenshots, music player, all manageble within the Potato Bios screen.

• Add lightwieght 3D backgrounds over 2D wallpapers with toggle feature to enable/disable.

• Activate Windows without needing the desktop environment running. (allows clean installs to install Potato on the fly)

• Re-write onto Linux kernal (such as Pop_OS) to replace the Gnome to Couch Potato as a new Gnome with same functionalities built in.

_(potential candidate would be to integrate Discord as an end all be all solution for chat etc, with controller support) _

:Callback:
CouchPotato was built for the Home Theater Gaming PC in mind. (Typical Living room gaming PC setup). It does not collect nor distribute any data of any kind. I DO NOT TOLLERATE IT EVEN IF IT WERE MINE. I GOT YOU.
