# CouchPotato
This software is a replacement to the Windows Desktop Environment that transforms any Windows based PC (designed for HTPC's in mind) the ability to quickly start gaming right from your living room couch or from the toilet, similar to those of a console in years past. 

Couch Potato currently functions as the underlying system to the OS and hardware with the only features you will ever use in a Windows environment, while gaming. 

This is not a replacement to a console or gaming PC of any kind. This is for those who want an easy setup in mind without the hastle of downloading driver's etc, for they are all baked in Potato's Potato Sack application on initial startup. 

There are basic settings you are able to adjust, all from viewing storage capacity to even changing your username of the profile baked into the Windows OS.  

Potato has future plans to integrate a basic online chat system with voice, view friends list from compatible sources, take screenshots, music player, (potential candidate would be to integrate Discord as an end all be all solution, with controller support) all can be done within the Potato Bios screen.

Potato uses "Dashboards" as an easy term for handling Steam, UPlay Origin, or Epic Games Store, etc. as a platform of choice used to launch your favorite titles.

Potato will always give you 3 seconds if you want to abort launching the Dashboard to enter the settings or to boot into the Windows Desktop Envrionment to retrive any new Windows/System updates.  Couch Potato currently will work offline until a new release supports Check for Updates.

Couch Potato is and forever will be a freeware product and is NOT RESPONSIBLE OF ANY DAMAGES INACTED BY THE USER. DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY LIABILITY DONE TO YOUR PROPERTY. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

DO NOT USE POTATO ON AN INTENTIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTER/OFFICE COMPUTER. DOING SO MAY ROT THE POTATO or GET YOU FIRED. POTATO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OF YOUR JOB LOSS EITHER.
