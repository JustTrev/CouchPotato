# CouchPotato
Couch Potato transforms all Windows based PCs (designed for HTPC's in mind) with the ability to quickly start gaming from the moment you power on your system. 

Similar to the likes of a console, this is not a replacement to a gaming source of any kind. Couch Potato is strictly intended for simplicity, lightweight functionality, but IS a replacement to the Windows Desktop Environment shell, built in mind of Home Theater Gaming PC's. (Typical Living room gaming from your couch).

**Explanation** 
Couch Potato currently functions as the Underlying System Environment for the main installed OS, with features you will only ever use in a desktop environment while for gaming.  _(The UWP apps and XBOX Overlay feature in Windows 10 and newer will not work with Potato at this time.)_.

Potato uses "Dashboards" as an easy reference for handling Steam, UPlay Origin, or Epic Games Store, etc. as a platform of your choice, used to launch your favorite titles.


**Features**
There are basic settings available to you that you can adjust in Couch Potato. 

• You can check storage capacity
• Changing your username of the profile baked into the Windows OS
• Adjust your graphics card settings. - _(Current GPU support is Nvidia at this time. Looking for further support to be expanded here!)_
• System Control Panel.
• etc.

From initial launch or a crashed Dashboard, Potato will launch the defined dashboard after 3 seconds. Within the 3 second time frame you have the ability to press F7 and abort the Dashboard launch to load the Main Menu of Couch Potato. From the main Menu you can also reboot back into the Windows Desktop Envrionment for any means necessary. 



**The Road Map**
Couch Potato, plans to integrate a basic online friends list, chat system with voice, take screenshots, music player, all manageble within the Potato Bios screen.
_(potential candidate would be to integrate Discord as an end all be all solution, with controller support) _



Couch Potato currently will work offline until a new release supports Checking Updates in the settings menu.
