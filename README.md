# CouchPotato
Couch Potato is a glorified watchdog client used to run from the Windows environment's registry. 

Couch Potato transforms all Windows based PCs (designed for HTPC's in mind) with the ability to quickly start gaming from the moment you power on your system. 

Similar to the likes of a console, this is not a replacement to a gaming source of any kind. 

**Explanation** 
Couch Potato currently functions as the new Underlying System Environment for the main OS, with features you will only ever use for gaming. 
_(The UWP apps and XBOX Overlay feature in Windows 10+, will not work with Potato at this time.)_.

Potato uses "Dashboards" as an easy way to reference any video game digital distribution service (such as Steam, UPlay Origin, or Epic Games Store, etc.) platform of your choice, used to launch your favorite titles.

Couch Potato is strictly intended for simplicity and lightweight functionality, as it IS a replacement to the Windows Desktop Environment shell, built for Home Theater Gaming PC's in mind. (Typical Living room gaming from your couch).

**Features**
There are settings available to you that you can adjust in Couch Potato. 

• You can check storage capacity.
• Changing your username of the profile baked into the Windows OS.
• Adjust your graphics card settings. - _(Current GPU support is Nvidia at this time. Looking for further support to be expanded here!)_
• System Control Panel.
• etc.

_More features include:_ 
From initial launch or a crashed Dashboard, Potato will launch the dashboard after 3 seconds. Within the 3 second time frame, you have the ability to press F7 to abort the dhasborad from loading.  Afterwards, you will then be taken to the Main Menu of Couch Potato. 

Within the Main Menu of Couch Potato, you can also reboot into the Windows Desktop Envrionment by any means necessary. 

Couch Potato currently will work offline until a new release supports Checking Updates in the settings menu. From there you will need to use the desktop environment to update Couch Potato files manually.

**The Road Map**
• Add update checker for newer releases.
• Add controller support.
• Integrate a basic online friends list, chat system with voice, take screenshots, music player, all manageble within the Potato Bios screen.
• Add lightwieght 3D backgrounds over 2D wallpapers with toggle feature to enable/disable.
• Activate Windows without needing the desktop environment running. (allows clean installs to install Potato on the fly)
• Re-write onto Linux kernal (such as Pop_OS) to replace the Gnome with Couch Potato with same functionalities, and Proton built in.
_(potential candidate would be to integrate Discord as an end all be all solution, with controller support) _

Couch Potato is and forever will be a freeware product. Couch Potato is NOT RESPONSIBLE OF ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND INACTED BY THE HOST OR SOFTWARE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
